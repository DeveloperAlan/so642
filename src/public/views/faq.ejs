<p>Welcome to StackChat, a derivative implementation of the StackExchange chat system, implemented entirely in javascript, using technologies such as:
<ul>
<li>node.js</li>
<li>less css</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
</ul>
We aim to give back to the community with this app, and hope that it is well recieved. We intend to keep working on this project in the future and open it up to more contributors and to allow for an open source (and community maintained) unsanctioned clone of the StackExchange chat system.</p>

<p>Please be sure to also check out <a href="/legal">our legal page</a> where we acknowledge the grounds for our recreating this without StackEchange's consent, but why we don't think this is a problem.</p>
<p>Also on that page you'll find all the projects that we've used here that we remembered to acknowledge (hey, sometimes you forget)</p>
